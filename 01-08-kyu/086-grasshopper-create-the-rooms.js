Escape the room
You are creating an "Escape the room" game. The first step is to create a hash table called rooms that contains all of the rooms of the game. There should be at least 3 rooms inside it, each being a hash table with at least three properties (e.g. name, description, completed).

const rooms = {
  room1: {
    name: 'Guidao',
    description: 'There is no rules',
    completed: false,
  },
  room2: {
    name: 'Folreo',
    description: 'There is a rule',
    completed: false,
  },
  room3: {
    name: 'Koulo',
    description: 'There is some rules',
    completed: true,
  },
};
